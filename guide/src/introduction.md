# Introduction

The [`cargo-bisect-rustc`] tool makes it super easy to find exactly when behavior has regressed in rustc.
It automatically downloads rustc artifacts and tests them against a project you provide until it finds the regression.

The [Installation](installation.md) chapter shows how to install `cargo-bisect-rustc`.
For a quick introduction, see the [Tutorial](tutorial.md).
Otherwise, start at the [Basic usage](usage.md) chapter to learn how `cargo-bisect-rustc` works.
